# CanineCourses
A learning management system that is modeled after an online training system for dog daycares and their employees.  It was created as a final project for Centriq Training's Full Stack Web Development Program.<br />
Administrators can create courses and lessons for those courses.  Employees can sign in and view course lessons in which they will watch a linked video and/or read an uploaded PDF. After completing all of the lessons for a course, the system will email their manager informing them of their completion.
